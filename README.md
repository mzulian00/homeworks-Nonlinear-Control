# Nonlinear Control and Aereospace Applications 

 Labs worth mentioning for the class of [Nonlinear Control and Aereospace Applications](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01RKXQW&p_a_acc=2023&p_header=S&p_lang=IT&multi=N) (AA 2022/2023)

 - [Lab 01](lab01/): Study of a chaotic system, and linearization through the Lyapunov Direct Method.
 - [Lab 02](lab02/): Feedback Linearization (**FL**) to ensure an accurate asymptotic tracking of a constant reference signal
 - [Lab 03](lab03/): Sliding Mode Control (**SMC**) to ensure an accurate asymptotic tracking of a constant reference signal
 - [Lab 04](lab04/): Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (**NMPC**) 
 - [Lab 09](lab09/): Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (**NMPC**) to 1. finalized to launch a spacecraft and place it in a low Earth orbit, 2. change the shape of a spacecraft orbit from circular to ellipsoidal
